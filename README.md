# KSPcontroller

## Introduction

For this project I will try tu build a controller for the game Kerbal Space Program. The game centers around making your own space crafts and flying them to different celestrial bodies. And here comes the controller into play. For the space flight, there are a lot of functions I want out from the controller. Thats why I want to model it on some older russian hardware [1](http://web.mit.edu/slava/space/essays/essay-tiapchenko4.htm), but make it so it fits with the games mechanics.
